    '''    Node interface for Adel General Option dict
		-leafDuration : the duration of leaf extension (blade and sheath); default value =2 phyllochron
		fracLeaf : the ratio between the duration of leaf extension before emergence (hidden part) and the duration of total extension of the leaf  ; default value =(0.4 )/(0.4+1.6)=0.2
		
		-fracLeaf =  leafDuration(hidden part) /leafDuration (total)
		
		-stemDuration: the duration of internode extension ; default value =1.66 phyllochron
		stemDuration= leafDuration/1.2 
		
		-dHS_col: the phyllochronic delay between the time when {HS=n} and {the time of collar appearance of leaf n}; dHS_col is used in Adel to compute the HS of tiller required to determine the tiller inclination kinetics.
		(e.g.when collar of leaf n appear, the HS= n - dHS_col)
		
		-dHS_en: the phyllochronic delay between the end of leaf extension (blade and sheath) and the start of internode elongation  ; default value =0 phyllochron
		
		-senescence_leaf_shrink : the reduction factor applied to blade width of senescent part
		
		-epsillon: the minimum length taking into account in adel ; default value =1e-6 (cm)
		(this parameter was introduced to debug Caribu that didn't support small object )
		
		-HSstart_inclination_tiller': the haun stage of tiller at witch the stem start their inclination; default value =1 
		{before this stage , the inclination angle is taken as constant (3 degree)}
		
		-rate_inclination_tiller: the rate of tiller inclination per HS; default value =30 degree //if (HS_tiller  =< HSstart_inclination_tiller) ,  TillerInclinationAngle=3 degree; ifelse  TillerInclinationAngle=Min (incT,rate_inclination_tiller*(HS_tiller- HSstart_inclination_tiller)  )
		
		-drop_empty: When checked allow to get an mtg with only the existing object (not empty object) at a precise time step.
